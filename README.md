# obstacle_avoidance_python_game

### This is a game in which the player has to go down to the next floor by using the direction keys and avoid touching or landing on the obstacles at the same time.
### The player should not stay at the same floor for too long before he/she disappear in the screen, for the screen will keep rolling up.

### We will have bonus for the player while grabbing hearts to sustain his/her life.
